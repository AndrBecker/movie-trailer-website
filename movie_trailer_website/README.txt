
--- Movie trailer website - Project 1 of Udacity Nanodegree Full-Stack Webdeveloper ---

This project contains the scripts and resources to generate an html-file
which on display in a web browser presents my favourite movies.

The project follows the specification of the final project of the Udacity
course "Programming Foundations with Python".

The resulting html-file ("fresh_tomatoes.html") was also checked in the
git-project.



-- How to generate and display the movie webpage

Run the "entertainment_center.py" python script with a python interpreter
(or a python development environment like IDLE).
The modules "media.py" and "fresh_tomates.py" must be accessible.
The "fresh_tomatoes.html"-file should be generated and displayed in the
standard web browser.

The movie webpage can also be displayed in the standard web browser by
double-clicking on the "fresh_tomatoes.html"-file (Windows).



-- How to install the movie webpage on a web server

Copy the "fresh_tomatoes.html" file to the http-document directory
of the web server (like e.g. Apache httpd server).



-- How to use the movie webpage

click on movie poster to run the movie trailer.
